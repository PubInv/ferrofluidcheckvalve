# ferrofluidcheckvalve

This is an attempt to build a *passive* ferrofluid one-way valve.
If this could be accomplished, it would be much easier to make
a pump-on-a-chip.
My previous attempts to do this were deeply flawed (see below).

I am now attempting to build a (very simple) physics simulation
of planar ferrofluid to test out some additional ideas
before 3D printing.
This was inspired by a Public Invention volunteer who did the
initial CAD design of my previous thoughs, causing me to
realize I had not thought deeply enough about the problem.

This project is now considered a failure; I've attempted to write up what was learned, which is [published](https://medium.com/@RobertLeeRead/failed-experiments-with-ferrofluid-742fa13b0ae1) at Medium
