Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article is a brief report on an initial but functioning design of a
 passive ferrofluid check valve (PFCV) that has no moving parts except for
 the ferrofluid bolus itself, which is stationary in normal operation.
 By passive, the authors mean a check valve that functions without changes
 to the magnetic field affecting the bolus, whether that field is induced
 by a permanent magne t or an electromagnet.
 That is, the flow is determined purely by the difference between the inlet
 port pressure and the outlet port pressure.
 To our knowledge, no passive ferrofluid check valve has been previously
 reported, despite being an active area of research and despite such a valve
 having significant advantages for operation and especially fabrication
 over valves with moving parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fundamental component of such devices is the check or one-way valve.
 Two check valves on either side of a chamber whose volume can vary creates
 a positive displacement pump.
 A perfect check valve opens or cracks with minimal pressure on the inlet
 side and sustains maximal pressure on the outlet side before collapse,
 allowing fluid to flow in only one direction.
 Following [Ref 7] we call the maximum pressure differential the valve can
 resist in the direction it is intended to check or block (from outlet to
 inlet) the sustainable or collapse pressure.

\begin_layout Section
Theory and Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research posits that a ferrofluid confined to a thin channel followed
 by an open area can function effectively as a check valve.
 Check valves are passive, one-way valves which prevent the backflow of
 liquid.
 There is a minimum differential upstream pressure, known as cracking pressure,
 between the inlet and outlet that will operate the valve.
 Check valves operate under the assumption posited below in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
|\vec{F_{m}}|\geq P_{f}*A
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $|\vec{F_{m}}|$
\end_inset

 is the magnitude of the force exerted by the ferrofluid, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

 is the pressure of the fluid against the valve, and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the surface area of the ferrofluid plug in contact with the transport
 fluid in channel.
 This leads to cracking pressure, which is when the pressure of the fluid
 against the ferrofluid exceeds the magnetic force of the ferrofluid defined
 below as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{c}>\frac{A}{|\vec{F_{m}}|}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In the system presented in this research the substance will flow through
 the ferrofluid plug when the cracking pressure is exceeded resulting in
 a pressure release and preventing the backflow of fluid into the system.
 Check valves have applications in microelectronics and medical devices.
 The valve presented in this research can be adjusted by changing the magnetic
 field, and thus the force exerted by the ferrofluid.
 This research focuses on exploring, both theoretically and experimentally,
 the simplest case of a static magnetic field.

\begin_layout Standard
Ferrofluids is a colloidal mixture of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles
 suspended in a carrier fluid (typically an mineral oil or other organic
 solvent).
 A surfactant coats each particle to prevent the particles from clumping
 together, maintaining the homogenous colloidal mixture as a fluid.
 The magnetica attraction of tiny nanoparticles is weak enough to allow
 the Van der Waals force to prevent magnetic clumping, and typically do
 not retain magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic
 field
